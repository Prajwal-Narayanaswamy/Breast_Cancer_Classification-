# Breast_Cancer_Classification-


## Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using Predictive Analytics model to diagnose breast cancer.
---

### Objective:
The repository is a learning exercise to:
* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process. 

The analysis is divided into two  sections, saved in Jupyter Notebooks notebooks in this repository
1. Identifying the problem  and Data Sources, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Machine Learning prediction using Logistic Regression Model
2. Using Deep Learning Techniques such as Neural Network to predict the output to be Beningn or Malignant.
